# Business-Insights-360 
## Project Overview
#### AtliQ Hardware, a growing electronics company, faced challenges in Latin America. They needed quick, smart data-based decisions. To help, I created an Power BI dashboard for their Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams, enabling better data analysis and decision-making.
## Project Execution
#### This project involves several steps:
🔸Connecting MySQL database to Power BI.

🔸Validating and transforming data carefully.

🔸Adding calculated columns for better analysis.

🔸Using strong data modeling methods.

🔸Building interactive dashboards.

🔸Regularly checking data and incorporating stakeholder feedback for ongoing improvements.
## Building Dashboard
### 1.Finance View:
Developed a financial forecasting model that improved the accuracy of budget predictions. Set benchmarks based on last year's performance and target goals for more effective budgeting.
### 2. Sales view:
Generated a report on overall sales performance for customers and products. Analyzed sales trends and monitored key performance indicators (KPIs).
### 3. Marketing View :
Developed a report on market performance by region and product, including unit economics. Analyzed market trends and monitored key performance indicators (KPIs).
### 4. Supply chain view:
Analyzed trends in forecast accuracy percentage, net error percentage, and absolute error percentage. Evaluated key metrics for customers and products requiring supply management.
### 5. Executive View :
Created an executive dashboard for real-time performance tracking, displaying revenue by division, customer, product, and channel.
